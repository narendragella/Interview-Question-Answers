✅ Your Final Profile (Now Locked)
Based on everything you shared, I’m building this for:
👤 Nagur – DevOps Engineer (3.2+ yrs)
🎯 Target: 8–12 LPA
🏗️ Environment: On-Prem + AWS
🗣️ Language: English
🏢 Companies: All (MNC + Product + Startup)
📘 Now Starting: PART 1 – CORE FOUNDATION

❓Q1: A server is slow. What will you check first?
✅ Answer (Interview-Ready):
“First, I check CPU, memory, disk, and load using top, free, df, and uptime.
Then I identify which process is consuming resources.
I check application and system logs for errors.
If required, I analyze I/O using iostat.
Based on findings, I either tune the app, restart services, or scale resources.”
❓Q2: Production disk is full. Application stopped. What will you do?
✅ Answer:
“First, I check disk usage using df -h and du.
I identify large files or logs.
I rotate or delete unnecessary logs.
If required, I move files to backup storage.
Then I implement logrotate to avoid recurrence.”
❓Q3: How do you investigate memory leak?
✅ Answer:
“I monitor memory using free, top, and vmstat.
I identify processes with high RES memory.
I check application heap usage and GC logs.
If required, I take heap dump and share with dev team.
Meanwhile, I apply temporary restart or scaling.”
❓Q4: What is Load Average? How do you interpret it?
✅ Answer:
“Load average shows average number of runnable or waiting processes in 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
If load is higher than CPU cores, system is overloaded.
I correlate load with CPU and I/O metrics.”
✅ Your Task (Important)
Before I continue Part 1, tell me honestly:
👉 Do you want me to:
1️⃣ Continue giving content here step-by-step
2️⃣ Prepare silently and give you final big PDF directly
Reply: 1 or 2

Excellent choice. 💯
This is exactly how serious engineers prepare — step by step, understanding everything, not just memorizing.
From now on, I’ll teach you like a mentor preparing you for 8–12 LPA interviews.
We’ll go deep, practical, and interview-focused.
📘 PART 1 – CORE FOUNDATION (Continued)
🔹 SECTION 1: LINUX – ADVANCED PRODUCTION LEVEL

❓Q6: Application is running, but users say it is slow. CPU is normal. What next?
✅ Answer:
“If CPU is normal, I check memory and disk I/O.
I use iostat and vmstat to analyze wait time.
I check network latency using ping and traceroute.
I review application logs and DB connections.
Many times slowness is due to I/O or DB bottleneck.”
❓Q7: What is Zombie process? How do you handle it?
✅ Answer:
“A zombie process is a completed process whose entry remains in process table.
It happens when parent doesn’t collect exit status.
I identify it using ps aux | grep Z.
Usually, restarting parent process clears it.
If many zombies appear, I investigate application bug.”

✅ Answer:
“I check %wa in top.
Then I use iostat -x to see device latency.
I find processes using iotop.
I check for heavy log writes, DB dumps, backups.
Then I optimize or schedule jobs off-peak.”
❓Q9: What is OOM Killer?
✅ Answer:
“OOM Killer is triggered when system runs out of memory.
Kernel kills high-memory processes to protect system.
I check dmesg and logs to confirm.
Then I tune application memory or add RAM/swap.”
